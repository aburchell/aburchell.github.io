## The Word
Swish swish bish

## Where encountered?
I heard this word in a clip from the Comedy Central show The Opposition w/ Jordan Klepper. It was used to 
describe Trump as he through rolls of paper towels to people in need in Puerto Rico after a hurrican.

## Meaning
This word is an exclamatory used to describe a good basketball shot. Here it used ironically/satirically to 
describe Trump's form of public support.

## Morphology
The root of this word, 'swish' is anomatopeia, coming from the sound of a basketball going through a net. This
word is then formed through full reduplication of the word, before adding the morpheme 'bish,' a stylistic
alteration of the expletive 'bitch.'
