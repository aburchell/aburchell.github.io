## The Word
Convalescence 

## Where encountered?
I once again encountered this word while watching the Netflix historical drama, The Crown. 
The sentence it appeared in is 
“l’ll need to have a further period of convalescence, put on some weight, but there’s nothing else to worry 
about.” 

## Meaning Guess
Based on the usage, I assumed this word was a noun relating to recovering or resting.

## Meaning

The word means “time spent recovering from an illness or medical treatment,” which makes sense considering the 
character who used it just had a stroke.

## Morphology and Etymology
This word is a loan from Middle French, which is itself from the Late Latin *convalescentia*, which came from
the present participle form of the Latic *convalescere*, meaning 
"a regaining of health." The word comes from the steam *valescere* meaning "to begin to grow strong" and the
prefix *com-*, which is an intentifier. This prefixation demonstrates a little bit of phonological change with
the /m/ shifting to an [n].
