## The Word
Multifariousness

## Where encountered?
 this is a word I heard from a Russian author reading an English translation of one of her novels.

## Meaning
It is the noun form of the verb `multifarious,' meaning `having many different parts, elements, forms, etc.

## Morphology and reflection
This word includes many constituent parts, such as the prefix "multi-," and the V->N suffix "-ness." I think I found it fascinating due to the length and complexity of the word, as because I obviously haven't encountered it before.
