## The Word
Vicissitudes

## Where encountered
This was again found in I Am a Strange Loop, in the sentence “I told all sorts of tales about the book and its vicissitudes.” 

## Meaning Guess
I initially guessed that this word meant something along the lines of "truths," or perhaps "secrets."

## Meaning and Morphology

A vicissitude is “a change of circumstances or fortune, typically one that is unwelcome or unpleasant.” The word 
is of Latin origin, from the Latin word “vicissitudo.” The only difference from this word is the change in the
word-final vowel, dropping the /o/.
