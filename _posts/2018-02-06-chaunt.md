## My initial guess of meaning
When I first read this word, I had no mental representation of the pronunciation, so I interpretted the pronunciation as ryhming with the mid-back 'au' vowel sound found in the word 'taunt.' This also let me to interpret the meaning as more or less synonymous with 'taunt.'

## Real definition of the word
It turns out that 'chaunt' is simply an obsolete spelling of the word 'chant!' The dictionary that I [used](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/chaunt?s=t), however, did list pronunciations mirroring both 'chant' and 'taunt,' so I was not off on the phonology at least! I find it interesting that over time, both the pronunciation and spelling
have changed, settling on a singular, popularly used varient. *Chaunt* was the most popular spelling for only a
brief window of time, around the 1580's, after which *chant* quickly overcame *chaunt.* It has held onto its 
lead since, rising in popularity pretty steadily between 1800 and 1950.
