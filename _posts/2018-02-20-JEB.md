## The Word
JEB

## Where encountered?
I had heard about this word (name) a lot of times during the presidential election, but it was only recently that I learned about the word, making it worthy of an entry.

## My initial guess of meaning
I thought Jeb was the first name of this Bush brother

## Real definition of the word
Turns out, JEB is an acronym! The former presidential candidate's name is in fact John Ellis Bush, which constitutes the acronym. Interestingly, the name is used recursively, ie he is refered to as Jeb Bush, and not just JEB.
