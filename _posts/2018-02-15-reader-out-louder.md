## The Word
Reader-out-louder

## Where encountered?
While talking with friends, speaking about reading out loud.


## Meaning
This word is a noun, meaning someone who reads out loud.

## Morphology and reflection
This word, in a sense, isn't all that interesting. In the first part of this compound word, it just applies the common and productive suffix '-er' to create an agent noun from another noun. It is the application of the suffix to the adjective 'out-loud' that makes this example interesting, and possibly even an example of creativity rather than productivity.
This dual suffixation in a compound word also makes me consider whether this is simply a suffix. Would it be possible to instead describe this morphology as a circumfix?
