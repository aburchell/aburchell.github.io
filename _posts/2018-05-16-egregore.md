## The Word
Egregore

## Where encountered?
I encountered this word while reading an article online.

## Meaning Guess
I included this word because I had absolutely no idea of its meaning, though I thought it was probably a noun.

## Meaning
This word is an occult concept representing a "thoughtform" or "collective group mind."

## Etymology
This word was first used in modern language by the French poet Victor Hugo, but it comes from the Greek word
for "Watcher."

## Morphology and reflection
This word was interestingly first used in French as an adjective, but was later used as a noun. This is an 
example of conversion. I am unsure whether the word could still be used as an adjective today, or even if it 
was ever used as an adjective in English.
