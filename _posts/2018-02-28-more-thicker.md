## Where encountered?
In the essay "[love is more thicker than forget]" by e.e. cummings

[Source](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/22224/love-is-more-thicker-than-forget)

## Meaning
The meaning of this word is pretty self-explanatory, as it just means 'thicker,' or 'more thick.' It seems to carry a 
sense of scale or intensity, however, that sets it apart from these other atested words.

## Morphology and reflection
In the poem, this unusual phrase seems to emphasize the degree to which the thing -- in this case, love -- is thick, using a double positive to double the strength. The poem also draws upon our instinctive unease with the incorrect usage of 'more thicker' to draw the reader in and question what the poet is implying.
