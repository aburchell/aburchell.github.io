## The Word
Contradistinction

## Where encountered?
I found this word while reading a philosophy paper about Nietzsche, Ardent, and Wallace Stevens.

## Meaning
It means 'distinction made by contrasting the different qualities of two things.'

## Morphology and reflection
This definition is so predictable from the clean morpheme parts that it is a great example of an agglutinative synthetic word. Is it possible that it is even a blend?
