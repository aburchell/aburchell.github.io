## The Word
Stink-like-shit
## Where encountered?
I again found this word from the podcast My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

## Meaning

This is a phrasal noun or possibly adjective, though from its offhand usage in the source material I am not quite sure. It was used in the context of a ‘litmus test of stink-like-shit’, used to tell if someone really stinks like, well, shit.
