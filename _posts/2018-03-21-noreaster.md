## The Word
Nor'easter

## Where encountered?
Outside.

## Meaning
A Nor’easter is a northeastern snow storm. 

## Morphology and reflection
Coming from the Midwest, I had never heard this word before, so please excuse the inclusion of such a seemingly ubiquitous word in my journal. The word seems to be, at the minimum, a blend (or shortening? Can splinters omit an internal part of a word?) of north and eastern. I am unsure if the “-er” is an added suffix instilling an almost animate quality of the storm as an intelligent if not malevolent being, or perhaps an inclusion of the rhotic from “storm.” The latter seems far fetched, but I am also not convinced by the former. Perhaps my Midwest upbringing limiting my coastal understanding.
