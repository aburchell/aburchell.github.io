## The Word
Stonedness

## Where encountered?
A vice article about anti-drugs, or drugs that have the opposite effect as common drugs. 

## Meaning
While testing an `anti-weed,' the author described a sensation similar to the effects of marijuana as `stonedness.' 

## Morphology and reflection
This is an interesting example of a word that seems strange because of synonymy blocking. The meaning that I inferred from this word is very similar to that of `high.' For example, `the stonedness was intense' vs `the high was very intense.' I suppose there is some difference, as `high' can also be a noun, but I still find this new word strange and suprising.
