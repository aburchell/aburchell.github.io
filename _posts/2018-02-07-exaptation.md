## Reflection
I think the differences between the dictionary definition and the definition given in the poem are very interesting. The poem definition is, well, more *poetic.* It also, and I found this particularly interesting for this class, mirrors how I originally interpreted the word, the 'ex-' beginning aluding to 'external' and the 'exo-' prefix. I think this mirroring of the reader's inclination is part of the reason that this explanation works so well in the context of the poem.
