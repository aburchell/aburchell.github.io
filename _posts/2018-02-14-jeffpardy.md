## The Word
Jeffpardy

## Where encountered?
I encountered this word as the name of a comedic video that my friend made. 

## Meaning
This word is the name of a fictional show that my friend created for a short video, similar to Jeopardy but with every answer and 
category and question being Jeff.

## Morphology and reflection
This word is a blend of "Jeff" and "Jeoparday." More than a great word though, it is a hilarious video.
