## The Word
Crocussed

## Where encountered?
I encountered this word in Kevin Young's poem `Crowning,' which describes the birth of the narrator's child. 

## Meaning, and Reflection
The word is used as a verb in the poem, but interestingly is derived from the noun *crocus*, meaning "any of the small, bulbous plants of the genus *Crocus*, of the iris family, cultivated for their showy, solitary flowers, which are among the first to bloom in the spring"' Knowing the definition of the word really adds to the line in which it is used in the poem, allowing a connection to be drawn from the first flow in spring to the birth of a first child. The shift from noun to verb is a very intersting morphological feature that I found used a lot in poetry for different effects.
