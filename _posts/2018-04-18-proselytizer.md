## The Word
Proselytizer

## Where encountered?
I found this word in the book *I Am a Strange Loop* in the sentence, "Soon I became a fervent proselytizer for my new credo..."

## Meaning

This word utilizes the agentive suffix *-er* and the suffix verb forming *-ize*, as well as a noun root that I don't believe I was previously familiar with.
A proselyte is "A Gentile who has converted to Judaism," and is of Middle French origin.
