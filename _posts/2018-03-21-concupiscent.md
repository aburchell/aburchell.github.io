## The Word
Concupiscent

## Where encountered?
 I found this word while reading the poem `The Emperor of Ice-cream' by Wallace Stevens.

## Meaning
The word means 'strong desire; especially: sexual desire.'

## Morphology and reflection
It's interesting to me that such a long and seemingly complex word can be an example of an isolating and analytic word, but the word comes directly from the Latin *concupiscent.* Additionally, I just enjoy the word because it's a fun one to say.
