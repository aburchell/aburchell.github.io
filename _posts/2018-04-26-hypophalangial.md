## The Word
Hypophalangial

## Where encountered?
I encountered this word while reading the novel "Infinite Jest."

## Meaning Guess
I guessed that this word was an adjective with some sort of diminuative meaning, because of the prefix *hypo-*.

## Meaning
This word is an adjective meaning 'having rough or shaggy hair; hairy, shaggy.'

## Etymology
Upon some internet research, it turns out that this word is a neologism, created by Wallace himself.

## Morphology
The word features the productive derivational prefix hypo-, which is a loan from Greek meaning “under.” The 
rest of the word is composed of the stem “phalange” meaning finger and the seemingly adjective forming suffix 
-al. The meaning of the compound is fairly endocentric, meaning something to the effect of “a smallness or 
absence of fingers or hands.”
