## The Word
Rototrembling

## Where encountered?
I encountered this word while reading the novel "Infinite Jest." It was used to describe someone's hands.

## Guess at meaning
Based on the usage of this word in the novel, I guess that it is an adjective used to describe a shaking caused
by using a Rototiller. I can't find an actual definition anywhere on the internet, so I guess this hypothesis
will have to suffice!

## Etymology
This word appears to be a nonce word, created by David Foster Wallace.

## Morphology and reflection
This is a really interesting word, morphologically. The origin of the first part of the word is "Rototiller,"  
which is a machine used
to till earth. This word seems to be a blend of "rotary" and "tiller," unless "roto-" is a prefix which I am not
aware of. This word appears to be a blend of "rototiller" and "trembling," creating a word of fairly endocentric
meaning, with the first part of the word serving a causitive role on the trembling.
