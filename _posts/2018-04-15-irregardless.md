## The Word
Irregardless

## Where encountered?
I encountered this word while surfing the web.

## Meaning Guess
I originally thought this word was a typo, and assumed that they meant *regardless.*

## Meaning
As it turns out, this word was not spelled wrong, but does mean "regardless."

## Morphology and reflection
I think this is a really interesting word in that the first morpheme adds no meaning at all to the word. Additionally, I find
it interesting that this word could be a blend between "irrespective" and "regardless," or between "irrelevent" and 
"regardless." I like the latter option, because it mirrors how irrelevent the *ir-* portion of this word is.
