## The Word
Regex

## Where encountered?
Using during lecture of Theory of Computation.

## Meaning
This word was used as a shorting/portmanteau of 'regular expression.' I thought it was an interesting example of a how a new word can be created and understood using only context clues.

## Pluralization
Another thing that I thought was interesting was the pluralization of the word used, 'regexes.' This intrigued me, as rather than marking this plural as 'regex's,' as I would think to do for an abbreviation, the word is pluralized as if it were its own, fully-fledged word. This is a a testement for our ability to quickly adopt and accept augmentations of words as new, independent words.

## Update!
The next time the word was used in class, our professor pluralized it as 'regex's.' I just don't know what to believe anymore!
