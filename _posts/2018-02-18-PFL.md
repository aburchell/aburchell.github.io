## The Word
PFL

## Where encountered?
This is a word that my friend uses, and presumably created.


## Meaning and Morphology
The word is an initialism, standing for 'Potential Friends List,' and refers to a mental list of people that she would like to become better friends with.
Interestingly, the initialism can also be used interchangibly with PF to refer to a member of the list.
