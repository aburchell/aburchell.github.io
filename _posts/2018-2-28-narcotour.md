## Meaning
A narcotour is a fairly new phenomenon of an experiencial tour focusing on the life and work of Pablo Escobar.

## Morphology
This word is a portmanteau of 'narcotics' and 'tour' or 'tourism.' Interestingly, there is also a very similar
portmanteau in Spanish, 'narcoturistas,' which are the tourists that go on these tours.
