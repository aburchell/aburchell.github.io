## The Word
Presbyopic

## Where encountered?
I encountered this word, like many others, while reading the novel "Infinite Jest."

## Meaning Guess
I had no idea what this word means, other than that it is an adjective, based on the word ending.

## Meaning
This word is an adjectival form of the word “Presbyopia,” which is “a condition associated with aging of the 
eye that results in progressively worsening ability to focus clearly on close objects.”

## Morphology and reflection
This word is an excellent example of the `-ic` suffix, which is productive and creates adjectives, originally
on Greek and Latin words (`presbyopia` is fittingly of Greek and Latin origin). The usage of this is what 
allowed me to guess that this word was an adjective, which 
is a testiment to how productive this suffix is.
