## My initial guess of meaning
I knew this word also had to do with clothes, though I thought it could be an adjective, as it seems to be describing 'tippet.'

## Real definition of the word
### tulle
*noun*
  a. A fine silk bobbin-net used for women's dresses, veils, hats, etc.

## Reflection
Although my inclination that this word might be an adjective was wrong, I was correct in interpretting the word as modifying 'tippet.' It just does so in a poetic, not concrete POS way.
