## The Word
Exeleutherostomize

## Where encountered?
I heard this word from Prof. Lila Fontes, when I asked if she had heard any interesting words recently.

## Meaning
This word is an intransitive verb meaning 'to speak freely.'

## Morphology and reflection
This word was coined in 1854 by English writer Rev. Dr. Charles David Badham in the sentence, 
> The heroes of the Iliad – shall we hide it to live, or exeleutherostomize it and die? – are for the most part boors.
While some sources list this as a nonce word, I have also found record of other sentences using the word,
such as 
> The offices of a General Manager of one of the few national banks is not the place to exeleutherostomize.
from B.S. Johnson's *Christie Malry's Own Double-Entry*, 1973.
The word, though coined in the 19th century, is created from Greek elements, namely *ex-* meaning "out," 
*eleutheros* meaning "free," and the verb-forming suffix *-ize.*
