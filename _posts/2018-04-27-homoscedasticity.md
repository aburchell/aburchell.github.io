## The Word
Homoscedasticity

## Where encountered?
I encountered this word while reading the novel *Infinite Jest*.

## Meaning Guess
I guessed this word has something to do with things being the same, because of the prefix.

## Meaning
This word is statistics term, meaning "a sequence or vector of random variables where all the random variables
in the sequence or vector have the same finite variance."


## Morphology and reflection
The prefix does indeed imply a sameness. Interestingly, knowing this allows me to understand "scedasticity" as
 refering to variance without me knowing exactly what the morpheme "scedastic" means, based on the meaning of
 the larger word. This word, as one might expect, also has a counterpart "heteroscedasticity" for variables 
 with different variance.
