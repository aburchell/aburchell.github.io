## The Word
Dirigible

## Where encountered?
This is another interesting word that I heard from the same source as “multifariousness,” the reading of a Russian author.

## Initial Interpretation, Meaning, and Reflection
Having heard it spoken, and in passing by a non-native speaker, I originally had it written down as *derigable*. In it's correct spelling, the word is either a noun meaning 'an airship,' or an adjective meaning 'designed for or capable of being directed, controlled, or steered.' I think the latter is the more likely intension in this context, unless I missed a large, aeronautical portion of the novel's plot.
