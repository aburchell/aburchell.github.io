## The Word
Incisionish

## Where encountered?
I encountered this word while reading the novel "Infinite Jest." I found it in the passage, `The jet's movement
and trail seem incisionish.`

## Meaning Guess
The meaning of this word seems pretty apparent, meaing "like an incision." 

## Etymology
As with many words from this novel, this is a nonce word created by the author.

## Morphology and reflection
This word stems from the word `incision,` but includes the productive, colloquial suffix `-ish,` which here
serves an adjectival purpose. The suffix, as I am familiar with, usually serves as a diminuitive, which I think
that it also does to a degree here, even though its primary purpose is to make `incision` an adjective.
