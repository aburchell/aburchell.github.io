## The Word
Horizonically

## Where encountered?
Ironically, my English professor said this word in my poetry class.


## Meaning
I believe this word is simply a misspeaking (or reimagining?) of the word 'horizontally.' It highlights the suffix
'-cally,' which is seems to be very similar to the suffix at the end of 'horizontally.' I include mostly because
it shows how even subconsciously we are able to create words that get the meaning we intend across, even if
we misspeak, and because I think it is a fun word.
