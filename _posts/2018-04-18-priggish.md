## The Word
Priggish

## Where encountered
I encountered this word in the Netflix show, The Crown. 

## Meaning Guess
Because this word was used to somewhat derogatorily describe the Queen, I predicted it was a negative adjective
meaning something like "snobbish." 

## Meaning and Morphology

This word is an adjective that means “self-righteously moralistic and superior.” It makes use of the productive
suffix *-ish*, which forms adjectives from nouns, in this case with the sense of "after the manner of." This would
lead me to believe that "prig" is also a word, which it turns out to be! This word, as one might guess, means
"a self-righteously moralistic person who behaves as if superior to others."
