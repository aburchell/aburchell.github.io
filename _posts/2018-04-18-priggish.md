## The Word
Priggish

## Where encountered
I encountered this word in the Netflix show, The Crown. It was used somewhat derogatorily to describe the Queen.is word in the book *I Am a Strange Loop* in the sentence, "Soon I became a fervent proselytizer for my new credo..."

## Meaning

While new to me, the word is apparently an adjective that means “self-righteously moralistic and superior.”
