## The Word
Forelock

## Where encountered?
Heard during a reading of an exerpt from a translation of a Russian novel.

## My initial guess of meaning
This word seemed to be a pretty stright-forward compound word, meaning some lock of hair at the foreground or front, presumably of the head.

## Real definition of the word
### forlock
*noun*
 a. A lock of hair growing from the fore part of the head, just above the forehead.

## Reflection
For once I wasn't wrong! This word is obviously very compositional, as the meaning could be readily guessed.
It is also the only time that I've seen 'lock' (as in hair) used in a compound or complex form. I feel like I 
always see it on its own, just refering to hair.
