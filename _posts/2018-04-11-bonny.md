## The Word
Bonny

## Where encountered?
I encountered this word while watching the Netflix historical drama, The Crown. 

## Meaning
The word was used to describe a nice castle, in the sentence “Isn’t she bonny.” The word is a Scottish or Northern English adjective, meaning “attractive or beautiful.” I had only ever heard this used as a noun, so this was an interesting find for me.
