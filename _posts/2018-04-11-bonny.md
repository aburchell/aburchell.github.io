## The Word
Bonny

## Where encountered?
I encountered this word while watching the Netflix historical drama, The Crown. 

## Meaning Guess
The word was used to describe a nice castle, in the sentence “Isn’t she bonny.” Because of this, I assumed
that the word is an adjective with positive connotations. 

## Meaning And Morphology
The word is a Scottish or Northern English adjective, meaning “attractive or beautiful.” I had only ever heard 
this used as a noun, so this was an interesting find for me. I wonder if a this word as an adjective is an 
example of conversion, or if it is a homonym. Either way, I wonder which form of the word originated first.
