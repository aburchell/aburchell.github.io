## The Word
Apotheosis

## Where encountered?
I found this word on Instagram, from someone who was promoting their radio program. This is the name of their program. 

## Meaning
Apotheosis means "the hightest point in the development of something; culmination or climax." The word is borrowed directly from Latin, so doesn't have any fun morphology that I am aware of, but I still thought it was a good word.
It seems like the type of word one would use to prove that they know big, fancy words. Which I think is fun!
