## The Word
Apotheosis

## Where encountered?
I found this word on Instagram, from someone who was promoting their radio program. This is the name of their program. 

## Meaning
Apotheosis means "the hightest point in the development of something; culmination or climax." The word is borrowed directly from Latin, which is itself from the Greek *apotheosis* which is from *apotheoun* which means "deify, make (someone) a
god." *Apotheoun* comes from the morphemes *apo* meaning "change" and *theos* meaning "god," creating the fairly endocentric word. *Apotheosis* also seems like the type of word one would use to prove that they know big, fancy words.
Which I think is fun!
