## The Word
Correcterino/Incorrecterio

## Where encountered?
I found this pair of creative words on Reddit, an forum-type website.
## Meaning

Interestingly, while the first was used as a verb, the second was used as an adjective. The sentence they

were found in is something to the effect of ”Sorry, my English isn’t great so please correcterino me if I am
incorrecterino.” This is an example of the creative usage of the derivational suffix ‘-ino’, which is found in
Italian, but not English to the best of my knowledge.
