## The Word
Augury

## Where encountered?
In some poem, which I unfortunately forgot the name/subject/author of.

## Meaning
Augury means the “the practice of predicting the future, revealing hidden truths, or obtaining guidance in future affairs on the basis of the observation and iterpretation of natural signs.” There is also a word “augur” which is "A religious official who predicted future events and gave advice on public matters on the basis of the observation and interpretation of natural signs.” I am unsure if “augur” is a shortening, agentative form of “augury,” or if “augury” is an action based on an “augur."
