## The Word
Augury

## Where encountered?
In some poem, which I unfortunately forgot the name/subject/author of.

## Meaning
Augury means the “the practice of predicting the future, revealing hidden truths, or obtaining guidance in future affairs on the basis of the observation and iterpretation of natural signs.” There is also a word “augur” which is "A religious official who predicted future events and gave advice on public matters on the basis of the observation and interpretation of natural signs.” 

## Reflection and Etymology
I am unsure if “augur” is a shortening, agentative form of “augury,” or if “augury” is an action based on 
an “augur." A more interesting question, however, is the origin of the Latin *augur.* I found two theories about
this origin. In the first, *augur* is from *augere,* meaning "increase," and relating to "an increase in crops
enacted in ritual." In the second theory it comes from *avis* meaning "bird," because, as my source states,
"the flights singing, and feeding of birds were important objects of divination." If this were the case,
then *augur* is likely a combination of *avis* and *garrire,* meaning "to talk."
