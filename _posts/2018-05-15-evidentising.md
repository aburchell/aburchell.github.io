## The Word
Evidentising

## Where encountered?
I found this word from a funny Twitter video, https://twitter.com/JamieAyling37/status/997084367691239424

## Meaning Guess
Before watching the video, I was not sure what the word meant, and figured it was a blend of
"event" and "advertising."

## Meaning and Morphology
This word is defined in the video by saying, "the definition is pretty self-explanatory." If
I am interpreting the joke correctly, then this word is a blend of "evident" and "advertising,"
and means "explaining or stating the obvious." I think this is a pretty solid word based joke.
