## The Word
Plaint

## Where encountered
I encountered this word in the book I Am a Strange Loop by Douglas Hofstadter. It occured in the sentence “...ending with the following plaint.” 

## Meaning

This let me to believe it is a noun, but beyond that I was unsure. As it turns out, it means “an accusation or a charge.”
