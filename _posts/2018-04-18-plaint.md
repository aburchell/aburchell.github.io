## The Word
Plaint

## Where encountered
I encountered this word in the book I Am a Strange Loop by Douglas Hofstadter. It occured in the sentence “...ending with the following plaint.” 

## Meaning Guess
The usage of the word led me to believe it is a noun, but beyond that I was unsure.

## Meaning
As it turns out, this word means “an accusation or a charge.”

## Morphology
This word, interestingly, seems to share the same stem as the word "plaintiff!" While I had never heard 
"plaint" before, "plaintiff is very common. I had never before considered its etymology, but it interesting
to consider now that I know the word "plaint." A side interesting fact is that the old English word for 
"plaintiff" was "plaintive," but it acquired the /f/ sound from Law French.
