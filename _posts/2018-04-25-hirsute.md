## The Word
Hirsute

## Where encountered?
I encountered this word while reading the novel "Infinite Jest."

## Meaning Guess
I really had no idea what this word might mean, other than it being an adjective because of how it was used.
This lack of a good guess has to do with there not being any clear English morphology happening with the word,
so it does not have a clear base from which I can guess the meaning.

## Meaning
This word is an adjective meaning 'having rough or shaggy hair; hairy, shaggy.'

## Etymology
This word is from the Latin "hirsutus" of roughly the same meaning. The word peaked in popularity most recently 
in the mid 1800's,
and is now roughly as flequently used as it was then. The most popular time for it, however, was around 1625
where it briefly had a huge spike. This spike is also the earliest usage on record, suggesting the word might
have been coined around then.

## Morphology and reflection
While I like this word, I cannot find much particularly interesting about its morphology, other than its
change in ending from the Latin "-us" to its more familiar English ending. I guess also interesting is that
the Latin "hirsutus" is related to, if not derived from, the Latin "horrere" meaning "to bristle."
