## The Word
Sibylline

## Where encountered?
I found this word while reading the poem “The Testimony of J. Robert Oppenheimer”

> the pure, sibylline intensity of it.

## Meaning
This word means “Oracular, occult, mysterious.”

## Morphology and reflection
I can’t identify any specific, particularly intering morphological features of this word, other than that it comes from the Latin *Sibyllinus.* I included it because I found it to be a simply interesting word, and one that I had never encountered (but I guess that’s not saying much, since that’s the point of this journal).
