Sibylline

I found this word while reading the poem “The Testimony of J. Robert Oppenheimer”

> the pure, sibylline intensity of it.

## Meaning Guess
While I gleamed that the word was an adjective, I couldn't guess any real meaning for it other than generally
positive or powerful connotation.

## Meaning
This word means “Oracular, occult, mysterious.”

## Morphology and reflection
I can’t identify any specific, particularly intering morphological features of this word, other than that it comes from the Latin *Sibyllinus.* This shows a shift in word ending from the Latin *-nus* to the English *-ine*.
