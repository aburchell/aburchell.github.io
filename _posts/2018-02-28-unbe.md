## The Word
Unbe

## Where encountered?
In the essay "[love is more thicker than forget]" by e.e. cummings

> and less it shall unbe

## Meaning
This word means roughly to "stop being," but with a little more poetic flair and additional nuances in meaning that are hard 
to put a finger on.

## Morphology and reflection
This word is formed by an unusual prefixation of 'un-' to the infinitive 'be.' I found this word interesting because of the unusual infinitive prefixation, but also because of its brevity and concision. It has a particular implication that I find very hard to describe, but seems to make perfect sense when read.
