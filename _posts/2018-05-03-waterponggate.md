## The Word
Waterponggate

## Where encountered?
I heard this word from my friend, who coined the word and used it as the name for a waterpong team.

## Meaning
There is not much meaning to guess about this word, as it is a team name.


## Morphology and reflection
I am not exactly sure how to classify this word. I think it is either a blend of “water pong” and “Watergate,” 
or from the stem “water pong” with the addition of the suffix “-gate.” This suffix, since the Watergate 
scandal, has become fairly productive, at least in the media, to signify a scandal of some sort. I am also
not sure how this word should/would be written, since I only heard it said outloud. I want to write "waterponggate,"
but it seems too long. Maybe "Water-ponggate." I guess this stems from me not knowing how "water pong" is 
typically written. I also don't know if one of the `g`s in "waterponggate should be deleted in the orthography,
since it is repeated.
