## The Word
Uncomplainingly

## Where encountered?
I once again encountered this word while watching the Netflix historical drama, The Crown. 

## Meaning Guess
I predicted this word was an adverb meaning in a not complaining manner.

## Meaning
This is an interesting word which, similar to what I guessed, is the adverbal form of `uncomplaining` which 
means "not complaining."

## Morphology and Reflection
It seems like a classic example of English’s agglutinative tendencies, and a nice long, fun word. Maybe this is just the environment in which I heard it, but it also seems incredibly British -- but again, maybe I’m projecting.
I also liked this word, because I did not know that the prefix `un-` could be attached to `complaining.` I 
thought it would by blocked by `not complaining,` but this is apparently not the case.
