## The Word
Uncomplainingly

## Where encountered?
I once again encountered this word while watching the Netflix historical drama, The Crown. 

## Meaning

It seems like a classic example of English’s agglutinative tendencies, and a nice long, fun word. Maybe this is just the environment in which I heard it, but it also seems incredibly British -- but again, maybe I’m projecting.
