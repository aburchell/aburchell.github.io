## The Word
Dribs

## Where encountered?
From a section of Walt Whitman's "Song of Myself"

> Hell and despair are upon me . . . . crack and again crack the marksmen, 
> I clutch the rails of the fence . . . . my gore __dribs__ thinned with the ooze of my skin, 
> I fall on the weeds and stones,

## My initial guess of meaning
When I first read this word, I thought of the in class example of lili and lolo, representing sound symbolism. Drib seemed to me the "lolo" to drip's "lili." By adding the feature [+voice] to the bilabial plosive at the end of the word the word became to me a larger, heavier, more intense synonym of drip. This interpretation adds a sense of urgency and severity to the flow of the "gore," and in my opinion isn't a bad way to read the poem.

## Reflection
As it turns out, my initial thought is pretty close as the word is derived from drip. The sense of scaling 
which I infered may not be correct though, as the first definition of the noun form of drib is: 
> a very small amount.
I guess this goes to show that you can't always trust the symbolism of a word!
