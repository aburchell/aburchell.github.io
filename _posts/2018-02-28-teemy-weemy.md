## The Word
Teemy-weemy

## Where encountered?
This is a word that my friend uses, and I believe invented.

## Meaning
The word means 'just a little bit,' just a teemy-weemy. Can also be modified with other similar, nearly nonsense
words, such as 'itty-bitty teemy-weemy.'
## Morphology and reflection
This word is, to the best of my knowledge, originally derived from the root 'tiny.' The vowels then get altered
to get 'teemy,' which is then reduplicated with some consonant alteration to 'teemy-weemy.' I really like this
word both because it is a fun mophological example, and also because it is just a lot of fun to say. 'Teemy-weemy.'
What a good word!
