I met the love of my life twenty minutes before I died.  

Picture it, twenty years young and on top of the world -- in-vinc-i-ble! I met her at my friend's place. She too was a pal of his, by way of proximity mostly. She lived in the unit just above his.  

Technically I'd met her once before. Must have been a month earlier. Maybe three weeks. We'd smoked together, briefly, along with a handful of others, brought together by the same mutual friend from before, or later, or what have you. She'd seemed cool. Nice smile, some wit to her. Cool enough that I tried to remember her name when she told me. Inevitably though, she slipped from my mind -- 3 to 4 weeks is a long time, ya know!  

I couldn't have forgotten about her the second time. Not that I really had enough time to put that to the test. But I'm confident. Call me cocky, but I'm positive! She seemed like the real deal, the whole nine yards,
