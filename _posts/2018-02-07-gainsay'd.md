## My initial guess of meaning
I initially read the word as meaning something to the affect of 'bring attention to,' as I was basing it off of the idea of gaining something, such as notariety, from saying.
## Real definition of the word
### gainsay
*transitive verb*

to deny

## Reflection
Though not commonly used, it turns out that the prefix 'gain-' means 'against, in opposition to.' This is an interesting find if you ask me! Before learning this, I assumed that the work was a compound, though this new knowledge makes more sense when considering the actual meaning.

This is also an example of a multimorphemic word stored as word-form, as highlighted on HW2.
