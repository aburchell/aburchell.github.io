## The Word
Ergaphobia

## Where encountered?
One of my professors asked (jokingly!) if I had ergaphobia, as well as explained what it means

## Meaning
This word means "a fear of work."

## Morphology and reflection
This word utilizes the very common and productive suffix *-phobia*, which makes it clear that it is describing
a fear. The morpheme I did not know was the first, *erg.* Interestingly, this morpheme is also a word which 
describes a unit of work. The word stems from the Greek word *ergon* meaning, as you might suspect, "work."
