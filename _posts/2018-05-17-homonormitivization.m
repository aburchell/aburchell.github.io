## The Word
Homonormativization

## Where encountered?
I encountered this word in a paper by my roommate, after she posted it on her Instgram story, presumably to
highlight the almost comically long nature of the word.

## Meaning Guess
Based on the high compositionality of the word, I would guess that it means the act of normalizing homosexuality.

## Meaning
Although I could not find a definition for this word (though it has been used, and is not a new word!), I did 
find information about *homonormativity,* which can either mean "The assumption that sexual and romantic 
attraction and activity between people of the same sex is normal, especially in a culture which also treats 
opposite-sex activity as normal, and which assumes all people are either male or female in both sex and gender,"
or "The adoption of heterosexist values, beliefs and norms into the queer community."

## Morphology and reflection
While I could not find a definition of this word exactly, the productivity of the suffix *-ization*, which 
forms nouns refering to the act of doing something, gives me a lot of information about the word. The entire
word is very compositional and agglutinating, making it perfectly understandable despite its length and 
apparent complexity.
