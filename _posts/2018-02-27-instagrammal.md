## The Word
Instagrammal

## Where encountered?
I heard this word while talking to friends. I forget the exact context, but it had to do with social media and social media presences.
## Meaning
This word is the adjective form of the noun 'Instagram.' For example, 'the social media adept student had a good instagrammal understanding.'
## Morphology and reflection
This is a an example of an apparently highly productive suffix. According to a bit of research that I did online, this suffix is usually added to a base of Latin origin. I have no idea if 'Instagram' is of Latin origin, but my friends apparently aren't subconciously opposed to the idea! I also don't know why exactly I transcribed the word as 'instagrammal' instead of 'instagramal,' but I did! Maybe I subconsciously prefered the '-mmal' like in 'mammal.'
