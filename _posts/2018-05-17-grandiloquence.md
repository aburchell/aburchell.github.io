## The Word
Grandiloquence

## Where encountered?
I encountered this word while reading a collection of poems entitled *God's Trombones.*

## Meaning Guess
This word reminded me of the word "eloquence," so I assumed it was a straight-forward compound meaning a 
grand eloquence.

## Meaning
This word is a noun meaning "a lofty, high-flown style of talking that has a lot of fluff but may lack 
substance."

## Etymology
This word is from the Latin *grandis* of roughly the same meaning and *loqui* meaning "to speak. 

## Morphology and reflection
While I correctly guessed a connection between this word and "eloquence," I was wrong about their relation. 
While I thought this word would signify an intensified eloquence, it actually implies speak that is too grand
to be eloquent at all. My ability to guess much of the meaning of the word, however, goes to show how much
the Latin morphemes of the word are used in English. My incorrect prediction is also interesting in that the 
meaning that I guess was much more exocenteric in meaning than the actual meaning, which is fairly endocentric.
My strong mental connection to eloquence must have led me astray.
