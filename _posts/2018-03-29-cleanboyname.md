## The Word
Clean boy name
## Where encountered?
Following the mention in class, I decided to look for these words from the podcast My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

## Meaning
This is a title that is presented in contrast to the ‘stink name,’ the name given to a character in a movie after they get filthy from their adventures – or something. This was used
in a chunk of the podcast that used a lot of great similar phrases, such as ‘stink makeup’, ‘stink filter’, and ‘stink meter.’
