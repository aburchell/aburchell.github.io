## The Word
Squirl

## Where encountered?
This is another word I got from Prof. Lila Fontes, when I asked if she had heard any interesting words recently.

## Meaning
This word is noun meaning 'an oramental flourish or curve, especially in handwriting.'

## Etymology
This word finds its origin in the mid 19th century, with a sharp spike in mentions around 1860, which then
quickly dropped again to nearly no usage between 1870 to 1990, where there has been a modest increase up to 
present.

## Morphology and reflection
This word is a blend of squiggle and twirl, or whirl. I find it interesting that there is no real way to tell
what two words this is the blend of, and yet the meaning is clear. This, I guess, stems to "twirl" and "whirl"
being tied so closely together in both form and meaning.
