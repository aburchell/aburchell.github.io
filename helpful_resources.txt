RESOUCES AND THINGS I'VE LEARNED

About the difference between <html> and <body>
http://phrogz.net/css/htmlvsbody.html
- html is defined by the size of the window
- body holds all the content, even past the limits of <html>
- body is `position:static` by default, so the sizing of it's children 
	elements will be sized relative to <body>'s parent element, <html>.
	If you want the children elems of <body> to work relative to <body>,
	set `body {position:relative}`
- <html> has `overflow:auto` by default, which is why scollbars automatically
	appear to show content in <body> that does not fit within the view
	of the open window
