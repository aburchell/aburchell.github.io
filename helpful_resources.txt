RESOUCES AND THINGS I'VE LEARNED

About the difference between <html> and <body>
http://phrogz.net/css/htmlvsbody.html
- html is defined by the size of the window
- body holds all the content, even past the limits of <html>
- body is `position:static` by default, so the sizing of it's children 
	elements will be sized relative to <body>'s parent element, <html>.
	If you want the children elems of <body> to work relative to <body>,
	set `body {position:relative}`
- <html> has `overflow:auto` by default, which is why scollbars automatically
	appear to show content in <body> that does not fit within the view
	of the open window

How to get, eg the nav bar and name header, to stay in fixed position
without fucking up the grid layout
https://github.com/rachelandrew/cssgrid-ama/issues/24
- Putting it inside a <div> then applying the `position:fixed` to that <div>
	will do the trick
