Hi, I'm Gus! This is the living workspace that I call my website.
</p>

<p>
In terms of usual, around-the-circle, get to know you questions, I am a rising
Senior (Class of 2020) at Swarthmore College. At Swat I am pursing a double
major in computer science and cognitive science, and am part of the improv
comedy group on campus, Vertigo-go. I've also dabbled in student government
and ultimate frisbee, but so far those haven't drawn me as significantly as
the activities with which I now fill my time.
</p>

<p>
More broadly, I am excited by the boundary between the human experience and
computation, and by narratives of all forms. These fascinations well up in
areas like natural language processing, computation creativity, and
human-computer interaction.
</p>

<p>
Professionally, I am currently exploring the world of education through a
<a href="https://teu.vassar.edu/science/">
  Teaching Experiences for Undergraduates (TEU) </a>
at Trinity College. In this program, a group of fellow undergraduate interns
and I do our best to get a group of rising highschool sophomore excited about
science and inquiry by facilitating a summer science program.
</p>

<p>
I am also a research assistant in
<a href="https://psych.nyu.edu/pelli/">Denis Pelli's Object Recognition lab</a>
at New York University's Department of Psychology. Working with Dr. Pelli has
been an incredible experience, presenting a baffling number of opportunities
including getting my visual cortext retinotopically mapped using fMRI, expanding
my knowledge of statistical analysis and data visualization, and presenting a

  various visual cortex areas </a>
at the Vision Science Society's (VSS) 2019 annual meeting.
