Hi, I'm Gus! This is the living workspace that I call my website.
</p>

<p>
I am a Senior '20 at Swarthmore College, where I'm a double
major in computer science and cognitive science. I'm also part of the improv
comedy group on campus, Vertigo-go.
</p>

<p>
I enjoy hanging out on the boundary of computation and cogntion. 
I'm fascinated by narrative, useful abstractions, and the
potential for technology to be magical. Always up for learning more
about design, natural language processing, HCI, or data visualization.

<p>
This last summer I explored the world of education through a
<a href="https://teu.vassar.edu/science/">
  Teaching Experiences for Undergraduates (TEU) </a>
at Trinity College. In this program, a group of fellow undergraduate interns
and I did our best to get a group of rising highschool sophomore excited about
science and inquiry by facilitating a summer science program. Check you and 
apply for this year's program if you're interested!

<p>
I am also a research assistant in
<a href="https://psych.nyu.edu/pelli/">Denis Pelli's Object Recognition lab</a>
at New York University's Department of Psychology. My adventure into the world of
vision science has been truly eye-opening, and has given me the opportunity to have
my visual cortex retinotopically mapped using fMRI, delve headfirst into statistical 
analysis and data visualization, and present a
<a href"https://visionsciences.org/programs/VSS_2019_Program.pdf">
  talk about the possible link between the phenomenon of crowding and the size of
  various visual cortex areas </a>
at the Vision Science Society's (VSS) 2019 annual meeting.
